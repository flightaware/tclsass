### libsass version support

The libsass library has several API changes over time.  The code has source dependencies on the libsass version.
Check your version of the libsass library. This code should work with 3.3.x, 3.4.x and beta 3.5.x.

Over time there was some mixing of C++ delete and C free in libsass API.  That can corrupt the heap.  The library libsass should free passed strings.  But as the API evolved, there are versions that do not free all the strings passed to the API calls.  This can result in memory leaks.  It looks like for tclsass the libsass 3.5.x will address all this issue.  The addition of sass_delete_options() will complete the memory management fixes.

If you have version of libsass older than 3.3.x, then set CFLAGS=-DTCLSASS_CALLER_FREE to free strings passed to the API. THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.  You will have to check the behavior of your specific libsass version.

### Configuration
 
You should be able to build with

    autoreconf && ./configure && make && make install

If you need to adjust the paths to locate libsass, use the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables to pass the paths to configure.


### Building

Some versions of gcc produce bad code compiling libsass.  For example, 4.8.3.

We have found that none of the tclsass tests will pass if libsass is compiled with -O2 but all of them will pass if it is compiled with -O1.

gcc 4.8.5 works OK compiling libsass with -O2.  We don't know what happens with 4.8.4.

libsass is writting using features in the c++0x standard that weren't added until gcc 4.6, so if you get something about option not recognized for -std, your C++ compiler is too old.

### How to use

Here is the revised spec (v3):

Tcl Package Format: TEA

Documentation Format: TEA

Tcl Command Name: "sass"

Sub-Commands: "version", "compile"

The [sass version] sub-command will have no arguments.
It will return the full version of libsass in use.

The [sass compile] sub-command will have the following options:

    -type <type>; # "type" must be "data" or "file".
    -options <dictionary>; # see below.

The [sass compile] sub-command will either return an error -OR-
the compiler output, which will be a dictionary.  The possible
named values within the dictionary will initially be:

    errorStatus; # always available, zero means success
    outputString; # success only
    sourceMapString; # success only (with source maps enabled)
    errorMessage; # failure only
    errorLine; # failure only
    errorColumn; # failure only

For the dictionary value of -options, the following names will
be supported:

    precision (int)
    output_style (enum)
    source_comments (bool)
    source_map_embed (bool)
    source_map_contents (bool)
    omit_source_map_url (bool)
    is_indented_syntax_src (bool)
    indent (string)
    linefeed (string)
    input_path (string)
    output_path (string)
    image_path (string) ... (removed by libsass, now an error)
    include_path (string)
    source_map_file (string)

This above list of options is based on the libsass public
interface and is subject to change in future versions.
